### What is recognEYES?

An iPhone app that engages children, who are in the early stages of
learning how to speak and read, with the world around them. When the
child taps on an object in the camera view, recognEYES narrates what's
in front of them both orally and visually.

### Purpose

To facilitate the early stages of learning in an engaging and effective
way. RecognEYES utilizes what's familiar to the child, their immediate
surroundings, and interacts with multiple senses for an enhanced
learning experience. RecognEYES aids children, whose parents are often
occupied with work or are not fluent in the target language, in building
essential language foundations at this crucial age.

### What we used

We used Microsoft Cognitive Services' Computer Vision API and Translator
API. In addition, we used Xcode and Swift.

### Features

-   Both a word and phrase mode for different levels of learning.
-   Different target language options, to aid bilingual and immigrant
    households, or children who would like to learn another language.
-   Audio feedback to add another layer of learning and to assist
    with pronunciation.

### Developers

Brian Li, Christine Wang, Barbara Xiong, and Daniel Zhou -- a team of
students at Duke University.
